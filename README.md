# JavaScript Data Structures

This repo is a compilation of data structure exercises and problems done while going through the Programming Interviews Exposed, 3rd Edition book. You can check it out here: [(amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/1118261364). It's great for preparing for interviews and may be easier to get into before cracking Cracking the Coding Interview ;)!

## Setting up the repo

This repo uses Babel, Mocha, and Chai to test the data structures. In order to run tests, run `npm install` and then `npm test`.
