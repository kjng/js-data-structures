This repo is a compilation of exercises and problems done while going through the Programming Interviews Exposed, 3rd Edition book. You can check it out here: [(amazon)](https://www.amazon.com/Programming-Interviews-Exposed-Secrets-Landing/dp/1118261364). It's great for preparing for interviews and may be easier to get into before cracking Cracking the Coding Interview ;)!
